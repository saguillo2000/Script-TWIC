# Script-TWIC

Automated download all zip PGN files from TWIC archive. With any python version should work, even though I used python 3.8.

Once you have all the PGN files, to concatenate I recommend to use the following command:

```
type *.pgn > TWIC.pgn
```

The last code of line is detailed in the following YT v√≠deo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd9L7fO45RI
